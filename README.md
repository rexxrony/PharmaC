PharmaC is a RESTful API project designed to manage customer, medicine, order, and order item data for a pharmaceutical company. It allows users to perform operations such as adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting data related to customers, medicines, orders, and order items. The project employs Spring Boot to streamline development, JPA for database interactions, and Swagger for API documentation, providing an organized and efficient system for pharmacy inventory and order management.
